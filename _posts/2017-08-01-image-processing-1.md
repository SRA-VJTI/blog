This 1st post will give you an introduction to IP whereas the 2nd and 3rd will give you in-depth knowledge about the math and coding behind it.  
Getting straight to the point, the 3 main types of image processing are digital, analog and optical. We will only be taking about DIP. DIP is a form of signal processing in which the input is an image and the output can be write an image or some characteristics of the image. The image is treated as a 2D signal. **Thus IP is a method to subject an image to certain process so as to retrieve information from it.**  
All the topics you would have heard of, such as image compression, image segmentation and computer vision all fall under IP. (Don‚Äôt worry if you haven‚Äôt heard of them üôÇ Cause you will)  
Why is IP so important?  
Image Processing has very wide applications and impacts almost every other field of technology. IP can be used to analyse signals that we cant see by our naked eyes (such as IR spectroscopy and UV imaging). Other applications include:  
*Image sharpening and restoration*  
*Medical field*  
*Remote sensing*  
*Transmission and encoding*  
*Machine/Robot vision*  
*Color processing*  
*Pattern recognition*  
*Video processing*  
*Microscopic Imaging*  

Basically anywhere that you can work with an image (or a 2d signal) üôÇ  
Image processing is really awesome when you think about the stuff you can do with it!! Get started on reading up on it ‚Äúhere‚Äù to see the very basic but awesome things that you can do with IP.  

That‚Äôs all for this post guys! See you in the next one where i tell you about the OpenCV IP library and coding for IP and also tell you about Computer Vision!!
