description: A brief idea about Lamington Road
---

Lamington Road is that place everyone has heard about but no one has been to. Everyone’s uncle buys computers from there, but it is relatively unknown that it is actually a hub of electronic items, and due to demand, robotics for Bombay’s thousands of engineers.

Step out of Grant Road Station (East) facing Merwaans and Co., a fine Irani with brilliant mawa cakes, and walk right under the bridge. Go left and immediately right, till you come to Servo Electronics, the house of all kinds of motors, propellors and wheels, and a very entertaining owner. Walk out of servo to the left and at the end of the lane turn right. Continue walking along this road as it curves left, till you cross a bank on the left and see Chip Components. Chip components has all the ICs you’ll need initially atleast, and at a fairly good price. Walk straight and you’ll come across Bombay Electronics (Motors/Wheels), Music Masters (Switches), Toyo Connectors (WIre Connectors). At the end of the lane, you’ll reach the real Lamington Road. Taking a left here will make you reach Lamington Road Police Station, just across the road from which is Visha Electronics and Gala Electronics, two shops perfect for beginners, but they’re out for your money. Be vary about both and prefer to buy stuff from a host of other shops I haven’t mentioned but are a dime a dozen in the Chip Components lane. Visha Electronics can be visited for basic stuff like PCBs, Discrete electronics components and some ICs and sensors which are hard to find elsewhere.

Some stuff you’ll need to start off with Electronics:

Multimeter (Buy a good one for about Rs. 150)
Soldering Iron (Soldron, again buy a good one unless you’re okay with getting electric shocks all the time)
Soldering Wire
Wires

But first figure out what you want to do. Perhaps a good idea is to look at a competition to take part in, maybe our own Technovanza or IITB’s Techfest/Nexus. Plenty of resources are given on their website as well, so have a look to understand more. Otherwise look out for other festivals that happen around Bombay under the IEEE.

Happy Botting
