**Math is everywhere!** Starting from the ‘paint’ software on your pc, all the way to ‘neutral networks’ (I mentioned it on purpose ;p. Ill be having a detailed post on it later)

Everything in IP is based on math too. From every function to every algorithm all use complex mathematical operations to achieve what they do. Even if you merge 2 images, there is an algorithm that is using math to ‘split’ the images into pixels, ‘compare’ each pixels of the 2 and do a weighted ‘addition’! This understanding what goes on behind the scenes is equally important as knowing how to write code. (This is especially for those who thought ‘coding is all I need’ )  
OpenCV’s website gives an [reference documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/refman.html) for all of its functions, which also contain an explanation of how the function achieves what it does… This should get you started.

If you have Matlab installed then install the image processing and computer vision toolbox. Matlab has a lot of inbuilt functions for IP. View them in the Matlab help, or see here…

Computer Vision specialists all make use of in-depth mathematical knowledge to make their algorithms. Every algorithm uses maths. A lot of times the base is Wavelet Transform and fourier transforms.

If you’re really interested there are a lot of channels on YouTube that cover the math behind image processing.

That’s all for the Image Processing posts, hope it helps you get started !!
