# Intro

We are living in a age witnessing massive leaps in the way computers are being endowed with increasing capabilities of performing tasks with what we call as Artificial Intelligence. We can now create software such that the machine can itself learn from large data sets and improve its own functionality through repeated testing which we term as Machine Learning.

The project which we are about to entail upon is GestureSense. It involves using of a computer WebCam to detect specific hand gestures and with the help of Computer Vision and Machine Learning, using them to control and operate our PC.

# Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, just like humans do with their eyes. It involves developing algorithms and techniques to process, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from images and videos.

# Neural Networks

Neural networks specifically deep neural networks, are a class of algorithms inspired by the human brain's structure. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. In the context of computer vision, neural networks are used to automatically learn patterns, features, and representations from visual data. These networks "learn" by adjusting their internal parameters based on training data, allowing them to recognize objects, shapes, and other characteristics in images and videos. The combination of computer vision and neural networks has led to significant advancements in tasks like image classification, object detection, facial recognition, and more.
